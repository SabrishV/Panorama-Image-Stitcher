# Panorama Image Stitcher

A Python-based project for stitching multiple images together to create seamless panoramic images. This project utilizes OpenCV for feature detection, matching, and blending to generate high-quality stitched images.

## Features
- **Automatic Image Alignment:** Aligns overlapping images automatically.
- **Feature Detection:** Uses ORB/SIFT to identify key points in images.
- **Homography Estimation:** Computes transformation between images.
- **Seamless Blending:** Smoothly merges images to remove visible seams.
- **High-Resolution Support:** Works with large images without significant performance loss.
- **Multi-Image Stitching:** Can handle more than two images in a sequence.
- **Robust Matching Algorithm:** Uses FLANN-based matcher for better accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision library for image processing.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ultimate-panorama-stitcher
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script with the images you want to stitch:
```sh
python Image_Stitching.py --images path/to/images/
```
Example:
```sh
python Image_Stitching.py image1.jpg image2.jpg
```
This will generate a stitched panorama as `stitched_output.jpg`.

## How It Works
1. **Feature Detection:** Keypoints are detected in each image using ORB/SIFT.
2. **Feature Matching:** Corresponding keypoints between images are matched using FLANN.
3. **Homography Computation:** A transformation matrix is estimated to align the images.
4. **Image Warping:** One image is warped onto the perspective of the other.
5. **Blending & Cropping:** The images are blended together seamlessly and cropped to remove black regions.

## Troubleshooting
- **Not enough feature matches?** Try increasing the feature detection threshold.
- **Images misaligned?** Ensure they have enough overlap for accurate matching.
- **Blending issues?** Adjust blending parameters to reduce visible seams.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for **360-degree panoramas**.
- Improved **seam blending** using multi-band blending.
- GPU acceleration for faster processing.
